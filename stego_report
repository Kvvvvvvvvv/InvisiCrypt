Intermediate Level (Challenging)
Goal: Add security, obfuscation, and usability

🔐 AES or RSA encryption of the message before embedding

📁 Support for other file types (e.g., hiding files in images or audio)

👁️‍🗨️ Avoiding detection by steganalysis (e.g., random bit patterns)

🌐 Web-based interface with file upload/download

🎨 Better image quality preservation

Difficulty: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) — Requires good understanding of image processing, encryption, and web/app integration.

🧠 Advanced Level (Hardcore/Cybersecurity Level)
Goal: Build something resilient, undetectable, and useful for real-world ops

🧬 Embedding in video, audio, or network packets (e.g., covert channels)

🤖 Use ML to detect or avoid detection (anti-steganalysis or stego-detectors)

🌐 Multi-layer steganography: e.g., hide encrypted ZIP + in an image + then inside video

🔍 Watermarking + tamper detection

🧱 Blockchain-based proof of hidden messages (audit trail / ownership)

Difficulty: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) — Now you’re in serious cybersecurity or academic territory.
